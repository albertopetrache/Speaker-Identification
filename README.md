# Speaker Identification
In this project, I investigated the performance of various speaker identification methods
using the Librispeech and TIMIT datasets. My methodologies included the use of fully
connected neural networks (FCNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), extracting
a wide range of features from audio signals such as mel‐frequency cepstral coefficients
(MFCC), delta and delta‐delta MFCCs, linear predictive coding (LPC) coefficients, and
spectrograms. I also explored the effectiveness of pre‐trained models such as
“squeezenet1_0”, “densenet121”, and “vgg16”.
